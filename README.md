smartsheet_tasks
================

List smart sheets you own and need to do from CLI

Get your API key from the SmartSheet website and insert it in the script.
You can display completed tasks by setting DISPLAY_FINISHED_TASKS to True.

Yes, it's a quick hack so its not pretty. It does what I need tho.
